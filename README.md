# ssup: an on-server chat app 
This very(actually very-very) simple chat app is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a JS library socket.io which is made for real-time-chat-based applications

# How to use???
So, firstly you need to install nodeJS on your system. In my case, I am using Linux so i'll type in the terminal - 
> `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
so now we have node installed on our system!
* now go into the root folder (ssup/) and fire up your terminal.
* type `node index.js` where index.js is the js file which will start a server on your system and will be using the port number '3000'.
* now open up a browser and in the url bar type "localhost:3000"
* i recommend to use it in maximized browser window 
* you can connect multiple devices and use it as a chat app( by typing in url bar : <ipAddress>:3000)
